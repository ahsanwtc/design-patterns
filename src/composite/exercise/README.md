# Exercise

Weâ€™re building an application for an incident management organization. When an incident (e.g fire) occurs, one or more 
teams may be deployed to attack the incident.

A team often includes a truck and one or more human resources. It can also include a subteam. For example, for a 
medium-sized incident, we may need to deploy two teams and each team may contain a truck and two persons.

Look at the current implementation of our application in the composite package.

What are the problems with this implementation? Refactor the code using the composite pattern.
