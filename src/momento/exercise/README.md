# Exercise 

Implement the undo feature using the memento pattern.

Our Document class has three attributes:  
- content 
- fontName 
- fontSize

We should allow the user to undo the changes to any of these attributes. In the future, we may add additional attributes in this class and these attributes should also be undoable.
